Monitoring the following URLs:
Resolving IP addresses...
Done! (1.25s)

Hostname: example.com
IPv4 Addresses:
  ‚Ä¢ 93.184.216.34 - No reverse DNS record

Hostname: github.com
IPv4 Addresses:
  ‚Ä¢ 140.82.121.3 - lb-140-82-121-3-fra.github.com
CDN Detection:
  ‚Ä¢ Website appears to be behind: Fastly
  ‚Ä¢ The IP addresses found may belong to the CDN, not the origin server

[UP] example.com - UP (HTTP 200, 324.45ms)
[UP] github.com - UP (HTTP 200, 156.78ms)
[UP] google.com - UP (HTTP 200, 89.12ms)
```

4. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop monitoring.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The tool creates a configuration file (`downdetector_config.json`) that stores:
- List of monitored URLs
- Check interval settings
- Last update timestamp

This allows you to easily resume monitoring with the same settings.

## üìä Technical Details

### Domain Safety Checks

The tool performs various safety checks to prevent monitoring of:
- Localhost addresses
- Private network addresses (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, etc.)
- Link-local addresses
- Other potentially unsafe domains

### CDN Detection

Identifies websites behind common CDNs including:
- Cloudflare
- Akamai
- Fastly
- AWS CloudFront

### HTTP Request Handling

- Configurable retries with exponential backoff
- Proper user agent rotation
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Automatic handling of redirects
- SSL certificate validation
