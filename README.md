- **Persistent Configuration**: Save monitoring settings between sessions
- **Detailed Logging**: Track uptime/downtime events with timestamps and error details

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages: `requests`

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Xnuvers007/downdetector.git

  Hostname: cloudflare.com
  IPv4 Addresses:
    ‚Ä¢ 104.16.124.96 - No reverse DNS record
    ‚Ä¢ 104.16.123.96 - No reverse DNS record
  CDN Detection:
    ‚Ä¢ Website appears to be behind: cloudflare
    ‚Ä¢ The IP addresses found may belong to the CDN, not the origin server
  
  - https://cloudflare.com

Check interval: Every 60 seconds

Press Ctrl+C to stop monitoring.

[UP] https://example.com - UP (HTTP 200, 423.45ms)
[UP] https://cloudflare.com - UP (HTTP 200, 215.78ms)
```

## üìä Status Indicators

- `[UP]` - Website responding with successful HTTP status code (200-399)
- `[DOWN]` - Website unreachable or responding with error code (400+)
- `[UNKNOWN]` - Status could not be determined

## üîí Security Features

- URL sanitization and validation
- Protection against private IP address scanning
- Configurable timeouts and retry limits
- Randomized User-Agent headers

## üìù Logging

The tool logs all events to both console and a `downdetector.log` file, which can be used for historical analysis and troubleshooting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

Edit the following constants in the script to customize behavior:

- `MAX_WORKERS`: Maximum number of concurrent threads (default: 10)
- `MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts for failed requests (default: 3)
- `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
- `RATE_LIMIT_PER_DOMAIN`: Time between requests to the same domain (default: 10)
- `DEFAULT_CHECK_INTERVAL`: Default website check interval (default: 60)
